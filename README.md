# Student Airflow Template

This is a ready-to-run Apache Airflow + Docker environment designed for classroom use. Students can use this to run Airflow DAGs that connect to MongoDB and process stock data.

## Before You Start

1. Clone the repo or click "Use this template"
2. Open the cloned repo in VS Code

3. Run the airflow-core-fernet-key.py script to generate a fernet key. This key is used to encrypt sensitive data in Airflow, such as passwords and connection strings. You can run this script in your terminal or command prompt.

### OpenMeteo Library Note (API Template)
`requirements.txt` installs `openmeteopy` via a Git URL for the API template. If the build fails or the package is unavailable, comment out the `git+https://...openmeteopy` line and rebuild the containers. The API template will automatically fall back to the vendored copy in `dags/libs/openmeteopy`.

you might need to install the `cryptography` library if you don't have it already. You can do this by running:
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

Then, run the script:
```bash
python airflow-core-fernet-key.py
```
4. Copy the generated fernet key and paste it into the `editme.env` file in the `FERNET_KEY` variable. Then rename the file to just `.env` (remove the `editme` part).

5. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. You can download them from the official Docker website. Here is the link: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/


## ✅ Getting Airflow Started

## Note
``` bash
# Stop everything and remove containers + volumes for this project
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
```
This will stop all running containers, remove the containers, and delete any associated volumes for this project.
